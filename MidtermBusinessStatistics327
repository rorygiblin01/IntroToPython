# 2000 x 18

# b) What are the names of the columns?

colnames(hospitals)

#  "Hospital.Number"       "State"                 "Region.Number"         "Control.Number"

# d) Are there missing values?

any(is.na(hospitals))

# No N/As

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# e) Which hospital has the lowest number of beds?

min(hospitals$Beds)
minBeds = hospitals %>% filter(Beds == 3)

# 3 beds, hospital 1064 or 1751

# f) Which hospital has the lowest expense?

min(hospitals$Total.Expense)
minExpense = hospitals %>% filter(Total.Expense == 1487)

# $1487, hospital 826

# g) How many hospitals deliver babies?

deliverBabies = hospitals %>% filter(Births.or.Not == 1)
nrow(deliverBabies)

# 1112 deliver babies

# h) Using ggplot, scatterplot number of beds vs Total Expense

ggplot(hospitals, aes(x = Beds, y = Total.Expense)) + geom_point()

# i) Using ggplot, scatterplot Admissions vs Total Expense

ggplot(hospitals, aes(x = Admissions, y = Total.Expense)) + geom_point()

# j) Using dplyr and ggplot, scatterplot beds vs Total Expense but only for hospitals that deliver babies

ggplot(deliverBabies, aes(x = Beds, y = Total.Expense)) + geom_point()

# k) One more question that you believe would be useful.

ggplot(hospitals, aes(x = Beds, y = Personnel)) + geom_point()

# i) For Pie Chart: One slice should be labeled Admissions.Choose another attribute for the second slice.

notDeliverBabies = hospitals %>% filter(Births.or.Not == 0)
totalAdmissionsDeliver = sum(deliverBabies$Admissions)
totalAdmissionsNotDeliver = sum(notDeliverBabies$Admissions)
pie_data = data.frame(
  Category = c("Delivering Babies", "Not Delivering Babies"),
  Admissions = c(totalAdmissionsDeliver, totalAdmissionsNotDeliver)
)
ggplot(pie_data, aes(x = "", y = Admissions, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  labs(title = "Total Admissions of Hospitals by Deliveries") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Delivering Babies" = "blue", "Not Delivering Babies" = "red"))

# ii) For the column/bar charts: Ensure that one column is titled
# Admissions. Choose a different attribute for the other column. 

filterSweetSpot = hospitals %>% filter(Beds >= 80 & Beds <= 90 | Beds >= 300 & Beds <= 350)
ggplot(filterSweetSpot, aes(x = factor(ifelse(Beds >= 80 & Beds <= 90, "80-90", "300-350")), y = Admissions, fill = Admissions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Beds", y = "Admissions") +
  ggtitle("Admissions by Beds (80-90 and 300-350)")

# iii) For Line Chart: one of the lines should represent Expense; choose another attribute for the second line.

ggplot(filterSweetSpot, aes(x = Beds, y = Total.Expense)) + geom_point()

# ii) The dependent variable should be Total Expense. Choose an independent variable from one of the remaining attributes.

expenseRegression = lm(Total.Expense ~ Personnel, hospitals)
summary(expenseRegression)

# iii) What is the value of the R^2?
# R^2 = .91

# iv) What does the �! measure in this case? ( Hint: Percentage of variation in … explained by …)
# Percentage of variation in total expense explained by personnel

# v) What are the pvalues ? How many pvalues are reported, why ?What does each pvalue mean?
# (Hint: pvalues have are related to generalizing from the sample to the population:
# what is the sample here, what is the population?) (1-2 sentences)

# the pvalues are 2e^-16, there is only one recorded a very small number so null is rejected,
# pvalues is the probability the event or hypothesis would occur. the sample here is the
# 2000 hospitals and the population would be all hospitals 

# vi) Explain R square, pvalues.
# the pvalue allows us to reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between the two variables
# and the r square value supports this showing the relationship between the two

#vii) What would be the right attribute size (independent variable) that seems most appropriate 
# to lead you in the expense range of $55–$75 million?

# this can be found by plugging into the equation given to us by the regression which is 
# Net Expense = 165.141Personnel - 2062.562 Solving where Net Expense is between 55 and 75
# million gives you a range personnel between 346 and 467

# i) The dependent variable should be Total Expense (the column in the data set). 
# Choose two independent variables from one of the remaining attributes.

multiRegression = lm(Total.Expense ~ Service.Number + Control.Number, hospitals)
summary(multiRegression)
# ii) What is the value of the R^2?
# R^2 = 0.043

# iii) What does the �! measure in this case? ( Hint: Percentage of variation in … explained by …)

# in this case it represents the measure of total expenses determined by changes in services offered
# and type of ownership control

# iv) What are the pvalues ? How many pvalues are reported, why What does each pvalue mean?
# (Hint: pvalues have are related to generalizing from the sample to the population: what is 
# the sample here, what is the population?) (1-2 sentences)

# the pvalues for both are very small (2e^-16, 0.00131) which means different types of controls
# and services offered are relevant information, each pvalue correlates to what percent the null
# would be occuring at, the sample is the 2000 hospitals the population is all hospitals

# v) Explain R square, pvalues.
# the pvalues show there is statistical significance between the two values but the low r^2 shows
# that there might be an error with the variance 

# Write bullet points explaining your results and why they support your conclusion: option A or B?

# I think that overall the safer bet would be to invest in the 300-400 beds hospitals.
# The total expenses that you have per bed on average are lower when you have more beds which 
# makes sense as a real world example. It also depends how you run the company as well, as both 
# regressions show the importance of services offered,personnel amounts and type of ownership 
# because they can play a role into your total expenses. You also should look into having a 
# hospital with birthing options due to the vast increase of admissions it can draw.
